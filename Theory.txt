* Node.JS is an open source server side runtime environment 
  built on chrome's v8 Javascript Engine

Node.JS can be used to build different types of applications 
such as "command line applications", "web applications", "real-time 
chat applications". rest API server etc.

Advantages
-----------
1. We can use Javascript to build entire server side application 
2. Asynchronous by default, so ot performs faster
3. Cross-Platform framework that runs on windows, mac and linux

DataTypes
---------
String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Object, function

Process Object
---------------
-> Each NodeJs Script runs in a process. 
-> This gives all the information about the current process

Module Types
------------
1. Core Modules - http, url, querystring, path etc..
2. Local Modules
3. Third Party Modules

module.exports
---------------
is a special object which is included in every javascript file
in the node.js application


module - It is a variable that represents the current module

exports - is an object that will be exposed as a module 


what ever we assign to module will be exposed as a module

module.exports ="Hello Word"

File System
--------------
Node.JS include 'fs' module to access physical file system

'fs' module is responisble for all the asynchronous and synchronous operations

Node.Js Event Emitter
---------------------
Node.Js allows us to create and handle custome events by using 'events' module. 

'events' module includes EventEmitter class which can be used to handle 
custom events


ExpressJS
---------
-> This is a webframework for Node.JS
-> This provides various features that make web developement easy and fast

Advantages
-----------
1. Easy to configure
2. Allows us to define routes
3. Allows us to create Rest API Server
4. East to connect to databases such as MongoDB, Redis, MySQL, MSSQL, Postgresql
